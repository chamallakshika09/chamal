    title: `Masters Thesis - Vessel Route Prediction from AIS Data`,
    // imageUrl: preview2,
    summary: `This research enhances vessel traffic monitoring by improving the Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS) with a more accurate route prediction model, crucial for high-speed scenarios and rapid course changes. Employing Kalman Filter techniques, known for their predictive efficiency, the study significantly boosts accuracy and performance, leveraging VTMS's historical data for reliable vessel path anticipation and preventing maritime incidents through timely course adjustments.`,

    title: `ICT SOLUTION TO MINIMIZE ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED (IUU) FISHING`,
    // imageUrl: preview2,
    summary: `Efforts to protect marine ecosystems are crucial in combating the impacts of harmful fishing practices. The European Union's laws play a key role in mitigating illegal fishing activities. While technology has improved fisheries management, its high cost and lack of localization are major challenges. This paper introduces a novel, cost-effective approach to fishing vessel tracking and catch reporting, addressing these issues and promoting sustainable fishing practices.`,

    // imageUrl: preview2,
    summary: `The Sri Lankan government aims to transform the country into an Asian knowledge hub, with universities playing a key role in this vision through research and innovation. While the research culture in Sri Lankan universities is evolving, with some projects leading to commercializable results, the challenge of commercialization remains significant. This paper discusses our experience in adapting a university research project for maritime traffic management in Sri Lanka, marking a step towards bridging the gap between academic research and real-world industry needs. It also explores global practices in research commercialization and Sri Lanka's efforts in this area.`,
